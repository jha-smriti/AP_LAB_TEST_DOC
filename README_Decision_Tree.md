# Decision Tree Analysis

## Overview
This project contains materials related to Decision Tree analysis and implementation.

## Files Included
- `decision tree image.pdf` - Visual representation and documentation of decision tree concepts, algorithms, and examples

## Description
Decision trees are a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. This project explores:

- Decision tree construction algorithms
- Tree pruning techniques
- Feature selection and splitting criteria
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Performance evaluation metrics

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Information Gain**: Measure of how much information a feature gives about the target variable
- **Entropy**: Measure of impurity in a dataset
- **Gini Impurity**: Alternative measure for node splitting decisions
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Techniques like pruning to improve generalization

## Usage
The PDF document provides comprehensive coverage of decision tree methodology, including theoretical foundations and practical examples.

## Applications
Decision trees are widely used in:
- Medical diagnosis systems
- Financial risk assessment
- Customer segmentation
- Feature selection
- Rule extraction and interpretation
