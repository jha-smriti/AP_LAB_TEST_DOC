# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project contains comprehensive analysis of the famous Iris flower dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and pattern recognition.

## Files Included
- `iristest.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with complete analysis, visualization, and machine learning models
- `iris pdf.pdf` - Detailed report and documentation of the analysis
- `iris pdf.docx` - Editable document version of the analysis report

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:
- **Sepal Length** (cm)
- **Sepal Width** (cm)  
- **Petal Length** (cm)
- **Petal Width** (cm)
- **Species** (Target): Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

## Analysis Components

### Data Exploration
- Statistical summary of features
- Data distribution analysis
- Missing value assessment
- Feature correlation analysis

### Visualization
- Scatter plots and pair plots
- Box plots for feature distributions
- Correlation heatmaps
- Species-wise feature comparisons

### Machine Learning Models
- Classification algorithms implementation
- Model performance comparison
- Cross-validation techniques
- Feature importance analysis

## Key Insights
- Clear separation between Iris Setosa and other species
- Strong correlation between petal measurements
- High classification accuracy achievable with simple models

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## How to Run
1. Open `iristest.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
2. Install required dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis
