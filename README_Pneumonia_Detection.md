# Pneumonia Detection Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on pneumonia detection using machine learning and medical imaging analysis techniques. It demonstrates the application of AI in healthcare diagnostics.

## Files Included
- `pneumonia test.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with complete pneumonia detection implementation
- `pneumonia pdf.pdf` - Comprehensive report and documentation of the pneumonia detection system

## Project Description
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. This project explores:

- Medical image preprocessing techniques
- Feature extraction from chest X-rays
- Classification algorithms for disease detection
- Performance evaluation in medical context

## Key Components

### Data Processing
